The current Daffodil International University Student Portal only allows students to monitor their quiz marks, quiz average, and midterm marks for each course. However, it lacks the ability to track presentation marks, assignment marks, and attendance marks, which are crucial for the final grade. Additionally, students cannot determine how much they need to score in the final exam (out of 80) to achieve a CGPA of 4.00 in a particular course.
